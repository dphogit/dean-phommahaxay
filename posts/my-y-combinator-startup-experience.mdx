Recently, I left my role at a Y Combinator backed AI-startup [Segna (YC W22)](https://www.segna.io/). During my time, I worked in designing and building the frontends for numerous products. At a core my technical contributions included:

- üî® Building features and pages for a [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) web application
- üë®‚Äçüíª Leading the development of multiple websites, iterating across pivots using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Webflow](https://webflow.com/).
- üîß Maintaining and contributing to a UI component library

In this article, I‚Äôll cover my journey from looking for an internship right up to my last day of leaving, reflecting along the way on the invaluable experiences I gained and endlessly appreciate.

## ü¶ò Background and Joining Segna

As a second year student (pre-penultimate) of a four-year degree, it was difficult to find an internship. Most companies were only looking for penultimate or final year students. I had applied between 40 and 50 internship roles before Segna, gaining two interviews in which I was rejected both times. While definitely a humbling experience, it helped me to handle rejection and how to pick myself up which is a key important life skill to have.

After being rejected on my second interview, I was on my last stretch of applications. I found Segna on LinkedIn and in their job posting this one line resonated with me and still does to this day:

> üìà We look for the gradient and not the Y Intercept.

I remember sending an email on a Saturday evening (yeah I know desperate) and receiving a reply on Monday morning for an interview on Thursday afternoon. It was surprising because at this point I was familiar to the long wait and rejection (most often no) email reply.

The interview was super chill and went really well! I took it as a good sign that we went over time without the conversation feeling forced. Next thing you know, the day after I was offered the role!

I learned during the interview and upon joining that Segna were a couple of months out from the YC program (Winter 2022 batch). Obviously I was super excited about the potential of this role. Everything was lining up, we were coming out of a 3-month-long COVID lockdown, YC around the corner, and I was about to start my new role üéâ!

For those unfamiliar, [Y Combinator (YC)](https://www.ycombinator.com/) is a startup accelerator and program to help startups take-off which usually means a growth of users and having more options for raising capital. YC have funded companies such as [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) and has a large reputation among tech-investors so being YC backed is a pretty big deal. In fact, Segna were the fourth ever company from NZ to be funded by YC!

## üåû Summer Internship - The Honeymoon Period

Three months quickly flew by. Day one we got familiar with the product, software architecture and codebase, as well as being assigned tickets for the two-week sprint. Day two we were straight into it. One of the first few memorable moments was my first PR which were just a few styling changes. Oh boy how nervous I was to merge in my branch. It was a really enjoyable period working on the frontend of our product, supplemented with weekly work lunches, caf√© visits and daily table tennis sessions (which sometimes got a bit competitive).

Startups have a stereotypical reputation for being fast-paced and this lived up to my expectations, I am always grateful for how well the company looked after us to ensure productivity was healthy.

My first piece of big work and most likely a large reason I was hired was to work on the new company website and get it ready for YC launch. It was an eye-opening experience to say the least, we worked with a contracted designer, and I was the sole developer on this, with both the co-founders supervising and regularly checking up. My main takeaways for SaaS websites:

### üåä A Website Is A Product, Not A Project

The website never stops adapting and is maintained for the long-term. I assumed once we finally deployed I was done and that I wasn't going to do any heavy work on the website in the future. However, I was wrong, during my time the website went under two major iterations because of our product pivots. It made me realise the importance of converting viewers into users through messaging and presentation, rather than just following a rigid design file and making it look cool.

### üé° Do Not Reinvent The Wheel - Use Whatever Tools You Need To

The user doesn't care what tech you used to make your website. They're interested in the product and the value they can get from it. We used Next.js, however we only used [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/), so we essentially did everything from scratch.

I remember at the time of starting, we decided that we didn't need any external UI library because of "bundle size". Looking back, we underestimated the workload of this and should have turned to a UI or styling library to reduce the friction of making the website responsive. It would have saved me loads of time from writing media queries and ensuring consistent styling.

When we pivoted the second time, we ended up just changing over to Webflow to save the hassle of development. It allowed us to spend more time on marketing, messaging and SEO. It was a major pivot, so I had to prioritise rebuilding the platform MVP meaning Webflow was ideal.

### üíÖ Make It Look Professional And Get The Message Across

The website of a company is their most important marketing asset. Any user who is interested will no doubt visit your website to find out more about your product(s). It has to be visually appealing to retain the viewers attention and make a good first impression.

A user is most likely to skim the website and most likely won‚Äôt read the entire website. Messaging needs to come from headings that stand out (bigger, bolder etc). Any visual elements such as images and icons are there to help demo and explain what your product does as well as make it appealing.

### ‚è∞ Communicate Regularly and How To Take Feedback

You are never going to get it exactly right the first time. For me, being able to regularly and clearly communicate with your teammates is the most important part of being an engineer. Being open to feedback and being able to walk through how you did something is a skill itself, and with any skill it requires practice.

I could never shake the feeling of nervousness off when asking for feedback. I learned this is completely normal and that I‚Äôm probably no different from anyone else who cares about their quality of work (I felt this every time my PR‚Äôs would get reviewed as well). Rather than trying to change that feeling, I convinced myself to not take any of it personally and that reviewing is simply for ensuring product quality for both the user and the team.

## üöö Going Back To University And Joining Segna Part-Time

I was offered to join part-time towards the end of my internship. This was exciting because it was something I wished to happen (and think I asked) during the interview. Taking this on I knew it was always going to be a good test for my time management skills, working twice a week and football three time a week on top of full-time university. Luckily, my strongest skill is time management. Ever since school I‚Äôve always been managing between my studies and footy, so my prioritisation and self-management skills came in handy as well as achieving some decent grades throughout the year.

Unfortunately due to the nature of the part-time work, there was a large amount of context switching and lack of productivity. I couldn't be given heavy or deadline-specific work to do for obvious reasons and mainly was coming in and completing small tickets (e.g. styling and minor changes). We did revamp our website and that was probably the most enjoyable part of my part-time stint.

Towards the end of my second semester, I was experiencing disconnection and felt like I was just coming in to get my pay for the week, losing purpose of why I was there. This isn‚Äôt anyone's fault. For me, it's just a symptom of working part-time and having an upbringing that was wired on productivity.

This period helped me reinforce a couple of my personal values:

### üåô Realise When It‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Good Enough Day‚Äù

Not everyday you are going to feel 100%, some days you feel tired or have a bit of a slow day and that‚Äôs fine. The most important thing is that it doesn't negatively affect anyone else whether its from your quality of work or distracting your co-workers.

However, it is as equally important that you form habits to stop you having these off days too often. I find that for me, playing football indirectly helps me engaged during the work day. I train twice a week and play on the weekends, it helps me keep fit, active and really helps with my soft skills as well.

### ü§ç Kindness Goes A Long Way

Be kind to yourself and others. I shouldn‚Äôt need to say anymore.

## üåó Why I Left

After university finished I went back full-time hoping I would reignite the spark that I had from my previous summer. We were pivoting again and it was promising. There was a lot of work for me to do and features to build for the new MVP, I was actually starting to feel that connection again as well as regain motivation and productivity.

However, a few weeks in resuming full time I made a U-turn and handed in my resignation that I was leaving at the end of the year. Despite the promising signs, there were also two major reasons I decided to leave:

### üõ´ I Needed A Break

During my whole university experience up to this point, I‚Äôve been either studying or working (both in the case of 2022). This summer is most likely my last chance to take a long break before going into full-time employment, so I wanted to use it to spend more time with my family and friends. I want to find another hobby during summer when it isn‚Äôt football season. I‚Äôm hoping it will allow me to refocus and allow me to put the majority of my efforts into a demanding final year of my degree.

### üìè Stagnation

While I was enjoying and being productive building features on our frontend MVP after resuming full time, it wasn‚Äôt beneficial to my learning. React and TypeScript is my forte, and I‚Äôm happy for this to be my main expertise during my career, however as a young Software Engineer I believe I still need to explore other domains in software engineering. While comfortable, I couldn't see myself explore other areas in the future if I chose to stay on. I decided I need to be brave and acquire other experiences while I can afford this risk. This is the only way to fully learn about myself and see what I really like and don‚Äôt like as well as gain more insight into a larger software market.

## üéÅ Wrapping Up

2022 was a big year for my career. I‚Äôm forever grateful for the opportunity to work and learn about the startup ecosystem. It‚Äôs given me a few reality checks as well as the foundations for me to propel myself forward in my career and that's why I‚Äôll forever cherish this experience. Catch you all in the next article!
